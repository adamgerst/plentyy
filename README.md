Plentyy User App
=======

Plentyy is a mobile app that allows users to access live, limited-time offers from local merchants.

Tech Stack: Angualr.js, Ionic, Cordova, Firebase

The Plentyy platform includes both a merchant app and a user app. The instagram-like merchant app enables the merchant to take pictures of store inventory with their device and submit a deal with an expiration time.  The user app features a clean, graphical ‘live’ feed of all current deals ordered by distance relative to the user’s current position.  Each deal is clickable, opening to a detailed view with a mapped merchant location and further options for directions, claiming, and paying for a deal. 

Both apps were built in AngularJS and Ionic to achieve a native app feel and mobile responsivity.  Each app was ported to iOS and Android via Cordova, providing full access to native device functionality.  Firebase was used for handling data storage and client-side user authentication, allowing for rapid development and deployment. 

Firebase’s Simple Login provides client-side authentication with both Facebook and email/password login.
